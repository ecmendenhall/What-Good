What.gd is a simple reminder to do good things and spend time wisely, inspired by Benjamin Franklin and Kevin Kelly. It generates a "life progress bar" and calculates the number of remaining days in your life based on standard actuarial tables. You can see it in action [here](http://what.gd/). I wrote it as a simple web application to help learn Django programming. The user interface uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and tools from [ubernostrum](https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/) and [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/css3-progress-bars/). This is my first Django application, created with lots of help from [The Django Book](http://www.djangobook.com/).
